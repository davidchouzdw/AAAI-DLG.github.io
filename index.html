										<h2>Introduction</h2>
					
									</header>
									<p>Deep Learning models are at the core of research in Artificial Intelligence research today. It is well-known that deep learning techniques that were disruptive for Euclidean data such as images or sequence data such as text are not immediately applicable to graph-structured data. This gap has driven a tide in research for deep learning on graphs on various tasks such as graph representation learning, graph generation, and graph classification. New neural network architectures on graph-structured data have achieved remarkable performance in these tasks when applied to domains such as social networks, bioinformatics and medical informatics.</p>

									<p>This wave of research at the intersection of graph theory and deep learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, inductive logic programming, program synthesis and analysis, automated planning, reinforcement learning, and financial security. Despite these successes, graph neural networks (GNNs) still face many challenges namely,</p>

									<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
										<li>Modeling highly structured data with time-evolving, multi-relational, and multi-modal nature. Such challenges are profound in applications in social attributed networks, natural language processing, inductive logic programming, and program synthesis and analysis. Joint modeling of text or image content with underlying network structure is a critical topic for these domains.</li>
									  	<li>Modeling complex data that involves mapping between graph-based inputs and other highly structured output data such as sequences, trees, and relational data with missing values. Natural Language Generation tasks such as SQL-to-Text and Text-to-AMR are emblematic of such challenge.</li>
									</ul>

									<p>This one-day workshop aims to bring together both academic researchers and industrial practitioners from different backgrounds and perspectives to above challenges. The workshop will consist of contributed talks, contributed posters, and invited talks on a wide variety of the methods and applications. Work-in-progress papers, demos, and visionary papers are also welcome. This workshop intends to share visions of investigating new approaches and methods at the intersection of Graph Neural Networks and real-world applications.</p>
